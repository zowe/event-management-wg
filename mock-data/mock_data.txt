#  Very simple mock data generator:
#
#  Line 1: topic name 
#  Line 2: data feed separated by commas. Use '%t' to use a base time modified by Line 3
#  Line 3: time interval to publish data in seconds. Either exact time per data item (must be ascending order), or a single value repeated (10 = every 10s)
#          Time entries of 0,15,45 publishes data at 0s, 15s, and 45s  
#          Time entries of 0,90,90,120 publishes data at 0s, twice at 90s (inexact), and once at 120s. 
#
#  Empty lines, and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
# 
#  If the mock topic does not exist, you must create it or set auto.create.topics.enable=true in your Kafka broker.
#
#  If the mock topic already exists, the producer will append the mock data to the existing topic.
#
#  This does not support arbitrarily long mock-data generation yet (produce 'x' iterations of data)
